This PCB includes :
- an ESP32 that enable wifi/bluetooth communication link,
- microstep driver to rotate a stepper motor. Motor current can be controlled by software. This can be used for torque limitation.
- magnetic encoder to get realtime angle feedback. 
- I2C OLED interface
- 3 push button + reset.
- Serial interface for programmation
- mounting holes to be directly mounted on the back of a NEMA 17

Using torque control and feedback position capabilities, learning scenarios by directly moving the motor are possible.

Power supply from 8 to 12V.
